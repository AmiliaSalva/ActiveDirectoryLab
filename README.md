## Overview

To simulate a real-world Active Directory environment, I attempted this lab to walk through the essentials of setting up and configuring a Windows-based network. The objective is two-fold: first, to provide a granular understanding of how Active Directory functions, and second, to explore the broader aspects of Windows networking. By leveraging Oracle's VirtualBox, I've orchestrated a simulated environment comprising two virtual machines. One machine runs Windows Server 2019, acting as the Domain Controller, and the other runs Windows 10 to emulate a client experience.

During this lab, we will:

- Set up Active Directory Domain Services from scratch.
- Create a dedicated Domain Admin account, ensuring security and control.
- Deploy a DHCP server to allocate IP addresses dynamically.
- Show the creation of an Organizational Unit for better user management.
- Delve into the intricacies of Routing and Remote Access to emulate a corporate intranet.
- Configure the Network Interface Card (NIC), ensuring local and internet connectivity.
- Demonstrate mass user management by leveraging PowerShell to batch-add over 1000 users.
- Interact with our client machine, simulating a login process using one of our newly added users.

## Technologies Used:

- Oracle VirtualBox
- ISO Files for Windows Server 2019 and Windows 10
- Powershell

## Installation

### Create Virtual Machines in VirtualBox

- Open Oracle VirtualBox and click "New."
- Name the first machine as "DC" and select Microsoft Windows as the type and Windows (64-bit) as the version.
- Assign at least 2 GB of RAM and create a new virtual hard disk of at least 50 GB.
- Repeat the process for our Windows 10 machine and name it "CLIENT."

### Installing the Operating Systems and Initial Setup

I initiated the installations by attaching the ISO files to their respective VMs. Windows Server 2019 required additional attention during setup to ensure proper administrative access. Here are the specifics:

- **Install Windows Server 2019:** Follow the on-screen instructions until you reach the account setup stage.

### Laying Down the Operating Systems and Configuring NICs

I initiated the installation process after attaching the ISO files to their respective VMs. The on-screen instructions are generally straightforward, leading to a successful installation of both operating systems.

In addition, for our Domain Controller, it's imperative to configure dual Network Interface Cards (NICs) for effective network management. Here's how I set them up

- **NIC for Open Internet:** The first NIC is configured to use Network Address Translation (NAT), enabling our Domain Controller to connect to the open Internet.
  
- **NIC for Internal Network:** The second NIC is allocated exclusively to our internal virtual network, ensuring isolated communication within our simulated environment.

This dual NIC setup equips the Domain Controller with the network versatility needed for real-world applications, aligning perfectly with our lab's objectives. 

Doing so has established a secure yet flexible network topology indispensable for our Active Directory Lab.




## Integrating Active Directory Domain Services

- Upon booting up Windows Server, I ventured into the Server Manager, and from there, I meticulously added the "Active Directory Domain Services" role.

![ACTIVEDIRECTORY LAB2](https://github.com/AmiliaSalva/ActiveDirectoryLab/assets/132176058/5877e1da-97c1-4d92-86ce-1c09d133d956)


## Crafting a Domain Admin Account

- Open Active Directory Users and Computers.
- Right-click and select New > User.
- Provide details for your new Domain Admin account and set a strong password.

## Set Up DHCP Server

- Back in the Server Manager, I incorporated the "DHCP Server" role, ensuring our client machine would receive an IP address dynamically.

## Structuring the Organizational Unit

- Open Active Directory Users and Computers.
- Right-click on your domain, go to New > Organizational Unit, and create an OU.

## Configure Routing and Remote Access

- Go to Server Manager and add the "Routing" role.
- Configure Routing and Remote Access to set up an internal network.

## Configure NIC for Internet Access

- Open Network and Sharing Center and go to "Change adapter settings."
- Configure the NIC to connect to the outside internet.

## Add Users via PowerShell

In an organizational setup, it's not uncommon to have hundreds, if not thousands, of users. Manually entering each would be an inefficient use of resources. That's why I've incorporated a PowerShell script for batch user creation. Let's dissect the script ```BulkAddUserScript.ps1``` to understand its structure and function:

### Define Variables:

    # ----- Edit these Variables for your own Use Case ----- #
    $PASSWORD_FOR_USERS   = "Password1"
    $USER_FIRST_LAST_LIST = Get-Content .\names.txt
    # ------------------------------------------------------ #

Here, two variables are being defined:

- ```$PASSWORD_FOR_USERS = "Password1":``` This variable sets a default password for all users. This script is set as "Password1." While setting a universal password isn't the best practice for production, it's suitable for this lab.
- ```$USER_FIRST_LAST_LIST = Get-Content .\names.txt:``` This line reads a file ```names.txt``` that contains a list of first and last names. Each name in this file is presumably formatted as "FirstName LastName", one pair per line.

### Convert Plain Text Password:

      $password = ConvertTo-SecureString $PASSWORD_FOR_USERS -AsPlainText -Force

- For security reasons, PowerShell commands related to user management often require passwords to be in the form of a secure string rather than plain text. Here, we're converting our plain text password from the ```$PASSWORD_FOR_USERS``` variable into a secure string and storing it in the ```$password``` variable.

### Create Organizational Unit (OU):

    New-ADOrganizationalUnit -Name _USERS -ProtectedFromAccidentalDeletion $false

- Here, an Organizational Unit (OU) named ```_USERS``` is being created. The ```-ProtectedFromAccidentalDeletion $false``` parameter ensures that the OU is not protected from accidental deletions. This is handy for a lab environment, but in a production scenario, you should consider protecting it.

### Loop Through Names and Create Users:

    foreach ($n in $USER_FIRST_LAST_LIST) {
    ...
    }

- For each name in our list ```($USER_FIRST_LAST_LIST)```, the following actions are performed.

### Extract the first and last names:

    $first = $n.Split(" ")[0].ToLower()
    $last = $n.Split(" ")[1].ToLower()

- The ```.Split(" ")``` method splits the full name into a first and last name based on the space between them. The ```.ToLower()``` method then converts these names to lowercase.

### Construct the username:
    
    $username = "$($first.Substring(0,1))$($last)".ToLower()
- This line constructs a username by taking the first letter of the first name and appending the full last name, all in lowercase. For example, for the name ```"John Doe"```, the username would be ```"jdoe"```.

### Display progress in the console:

    Write-Host "Creating user: $($username)" -BackgroundColor Black -ForegroundColor Cyan
    
- This line displays a message in the console to show which user is being created.

### Create the new user:


    New-AdUser ...

- The ```New-AdUser``` cmdlet creates a new user in Active Directory. The script specifies various parameters such as the given name, surname, display name, etc., and places the user in the previously created ```_USERS OU```. The ```-PasswordNeverExpires $true``` parameter ensures that the user's password does not expire, which is fine for a lab environment. Still, you generally want to set an expiration in a live production environment.


### Why are we doing this?

The main goal of this script is to demonstrate automation capabilities in Active Directory management, especially when dealing with a large number of users. Rather than manually entering each user, which can be a time-consuming and error-prone process, this script streamlines and automates the task, ensuring consistency and efficiency. It showcases the power of PowerShell scripting in managing Windows environments and offers a practical example of its application in real-world scenarios.

### Client Interaction and User Experience

With our Windows 10 VM ready, I configured it to connect to our server's environment. Subsequently, I logged off and back in, simulating the experience of one of our batch-created users.
